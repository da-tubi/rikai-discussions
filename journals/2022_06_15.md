- This is Rikai weekly community discussion, original members: [[Darcy Shen]], [[Eddy Xu]], [[Chang She]], [[Renkai Ge]]
- We can just make this notebook a [[github]] repository
- Key features:
	- to create a journal file for you every day
	- to organize key concepts automatically
	- We can manage knowledge and ideas like manage code in IDE. Here the IDE is just [[logseq]] itself.
- The content is in pure text, try `cat journals/2022_06_15.md`
- #+BEGIN_TIP
  Let's have some real world example
  #+END_TIP
- [[Renkai Ge]] believes we can let [[CI]] check [[License]] automatically, and if we put the tests in a random order, the [[CI]] can be statistically faster

	- https://github.com/eto-ai/rikai/issues/680
- An example of alias:
	- [[Eddy Xu]] is also [[Lei Xu]]
- Advanced features, like queries, check the official doc:
	- https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/queries
- Users have some pain point on data [[format]]
	- check the google doc:
		- TODO [[Eddy Xu]] should paste the address here
	- [[Google]] released idea:
		- [[Procella]]: Unifying serving and analytical data at [[YouTube]]
		- to have point query on [[parquet]]
		- http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p2022-chattopadhyay.pdf
	- summarize:
		- sql, pandas, postgres, some ML framework
		- smaller companies tend to compute in local machine, not on cloud, because a laptop or desktop is capable for computing
		- can we design a [[format]] that can be shared through different databases or frameworks?
- Pictures in [[Medical Science]] would be very large, maybe 5GiB for one pic
- [[Darcy Shen]] would try to upscale old animations with [[Spark]] and [[Spark-video]]
	- and try to make some fancy API on [[Rikai]]
- [[Eddy Xu]] would push some [[Schema]] related change
- Above [[Python]] 3.8, we can try to use it's builtin functions to manage version, rather than maintain a version file manually
	- A package we can use:
		- https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm
	- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10214827/find-which-version-of-package-is-installed-with-pip
- Should we release a package for [[Apple M]] chips?
